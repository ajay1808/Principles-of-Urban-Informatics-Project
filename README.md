## Bike Infrastructure Accessibility and Safety in NYC

The research aims to explore the current accessibility of bike-friendly infrastructure in NYC and its distribution among different communities. Additionally, the study will investigate the relationship between bike-friendly infrastructure and bike accidents in the city.

Data Preparation:

[Accident Data](https://github.com/ajay1808/Principles-of-Urban-Informatics-Project/blob/main/Accident%20Data%20Prep.ipynb): Finding the count of docks in each zipcode of NYC. This yields the following this [dataset](https://github.com/ajay1808/Principles-of-Urban-Informatics-Project/blob/main/Accidents_Normalized_Zipcodes.csv)

[Citibike](https://github.com/ajay1808/Principles-of-Urban-Informatics-Project/blob/main/Citibike_Infrastructure.ipynb):Finding the count of citibike in each zipcode of NYC. This count is normalized by the Citibike Ridership count for each zipcode. This yields the following this [dataset](https://github.com/ajay1808/Principles-of-Urban-Informatics-Project/blob/main/Accidents_Normalized_Zipcodes.csv](https://github.com/ajay1808/Principles-of-Urban-Informatics-Project/blob/main/citibike_merge.csv)

[Bike Infrastructure](https://github.com/ajay1808/Principles-of-Urban-Informatics-Project/blob/main/NYC%20Bike%20Infrastructure%20Density.ipynb): This calculates the bike infrastructure by dividing the length of bike lanes by the length of roads. [Output](https://github.com/ajay1808/Principles-of-Urban-Informatics-Project/blob/main/Bike%20Infrastructure%20Density.csv)

[Income](https://github.com/ajay1808/Principles-of-Urban-Informatics-Project/blob/main/Zipcode_NYC_prep.ipynb): Mean income of each Zipcode. [Output](https://github.com/ajay1808/Principles-of-Urban-Informatics-Project/blob/main/NYC_Income.csv)
